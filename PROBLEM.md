## Practice Statement: Eligibility Criteria for an Exam

**At an engineering college, the minimum attendance required for a student to be eligible to appear for the year-end examination is 75%. A student who does not meet this criteria can take this examination only if there is a medical reason for the short attendance. The college administration needs to check the eligibility of each student for the year-end examination.**
 
    a.  Write an algorithm that takes the total number of classes held in the year and the number of classes attended by the student as input and determines if the student is eligible to take the examination. 
    b.  Draw a corresponding Raptor flowchart.
    c.  Create a Scratch program based on the flowchart drawn.
